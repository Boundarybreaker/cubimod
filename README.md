# cubimod
Fork of a Starbound mod made by CrepeMuse, updated for newer versions of Starbound.

**This mod was not originally created by me.** I'm putting it on github to collaborate with a friend to improve it and keep it updated along with Starbound.

Differences from original:
-Added compatibility with Starbound 1.3 Spacefarer (mechs, new navigation system)
-Created a Cubi personal teleporter, styled off the Cubi ship's teleporter
-Created a placeholder texture for the Tier 4 ship

To do:
-Create final textures for ships tier 4-8
-Create more race-specific items (flags, etc.)
-Potential full redesign of Cubi aesthetic, changing it from gore-y with flesh and bones to a softer but still vaguely similar look and feel
